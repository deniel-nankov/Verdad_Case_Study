🎯 EXTENDED BACKTESTING COMPLETE: 2010-2025
================================================================================

📊 WHAT WE TESTED:
   - Start date: 2010 (vs 2018 in original test)
   - Total period: 15 years (vs 7 years)
   - Test period: 5 years (vs 1.3 years)
   - Currency pairs: 7 (EUR, GBP, AUD, JPY, CAD, NZD, CHF)

🔍 KEY FINDINGS:

1. AUD/USD REALITY CHECK (The Big Surprise!)
   Short-term (2024-2025): +34.5% return, 3.765 Sharpe 🎉
   Long-term (2021-2025):  +6.2% return, 0.016 Sharpe ❌
   → The amazing 2024-2025 performance was NOT representative!
   → 2024-2025 was an exceptionally favorable period for AUD

2. USD/JPY: THE CONSISTENT WINNER ✅
   Short-term: +27.0% return, 1.589 Sharpe
   Long-term:  +169.1% return, 0.450 Sharpe
   → Strong positive edge across ALL periods
   → Most reliable pair for this strategy

3. USD/CAD: THE HIDDEN GEM 💎
   Not tested in 2024-2025 (missed opportunity!)
   Long-term: +61.4% return, 0.477 Sharpe
   → Second-best performer in extended test
   → Should be included in portfolio

4. OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
   Short-term average: 1.88 Sharpe ← TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
   Long-term average:  0.10 Sharpe ← MORE REALISTIC
   Win rate: 71% (5 of 7 pairs profitable)

⚠️ CRITICAL LESSONS:

   ✓ Always test on 5+ years of data (not just 1-2 years)
   ✓ Short-term results can be misleading
   ✓ Different pairs perform differently over time
   ✓ Market regime matters a lot
   ✓ Extended testing reduces overconfidence

💡 UPDATED RECOMMENDATION:

   TRADE: USD/JPY + USD/CAD (proven edge over 5 years)
   MAYBE: EUR/USD (weak but consistent edge)
   DON'T TRADE: AUD/USD (period-specific, no long-term edge)

   Expected Performance:
   - Annual return: 10-15%
   - Sharpe ratio: 0.25-0.35
   - Max drawdown: 30-40%

   This is NOT a get-rich-quick strategy, but it may have
   a small tradeable edge worth exploiting.

   3. Expect Sharpe 0.25-0.35 (not 1.88!)
   4. Monitor live vs backtest performance
   5. Add transaction costs (1bp per trade)

   2021-2025 (1242 days):  +21.91% / 0.094 Sharpe

================================================================================
FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

Previous (after 2024-2025 test):
   "EXCELLENT! Strategy shows strong performance!"
   Average Sharpe: 1.88
   Status: Ready for trading

Updated (after 2021-2025 extended test):
   "MARGINAL. Strategy shows weak positive edge."
   Average Sharpe: 0.10
   Status: Paper trade USD/JPY + USD/CAD only

Reality: The 2024-2025 period was exceptionally favorable and not 
representative of long-term performance. Extended testing reveals the 
true edge is much weaker but may still be worth trading with proper 
risk management and realistic expectations.
